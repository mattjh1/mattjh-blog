So, this happenedâ€”Iâ€™m now **KCNA certified**! ðŸŽ‰

For those unfamiliar, **KCNA (Kubernetes and Cloud Native Associate)** is basically a stamp of approval that says, _"Yep, this person understands Kubernetes and cloud-native technologies well enough to not completely brick production"_

## The Journey (And the Posts I Half-Finished)

A while back, I started writing about my deep dive into cloud-native conceptsâ€”[Part 1](../kcna-part1), [Part 2](../kcna-part2), [Part 3](../kcna-part3), [Part 4](../kcna-part4)â€”you get the idea. The plan was to document the whole journey, but somewhere along the way, writing about it got _way_ more tedious than just doing the work.

Did I finish the series? Nope. Did I still get the cert? Absolutely.

### What I Learned

Studying for KCNA covered a lot of ground, some of which I was already familiar with, and some that filled in the gaps:

- **Kubernetes basics** (clusters, pods, nodesâ€”things I now _officially_ know)
- **Cloud-native tooling** (GitOps, networking, storage, service meshesâ€”buzzwords that finally clicked)
- **kubectl commands** (I may not have them all memorized, but at least I know _what_ I should be looking up)
- **Cloud-native security** (A friendly reminder that just because something works doesnâ€™t mean itâ€™s _secure_)

### Whatâ€™s Next?

KCNA is a great first step, but I know thereâ€™s still a lot more to explore. Kubernetes is huge, and while I wouldnâ€™t call myself an admin just yet, this cert gives me a solid foundation to build on. Maybe **CKAD** or **CKA** is in the futureâ€”or maybe Iâ€™ll just keep messing around with containers until it all clicks.

Either way, this was a fun challenge, and Iâ€™m glad I did it. If youâ€™re thinking about KCNA, Iâ€™d say go for itâ€”itâ€™s a great way to level up, even if youâ€™re just starting to get into Kubernetes.
