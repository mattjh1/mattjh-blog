Okay so I'm still not convinced this will work for me, but I will be giving it my very best attempt. Needless to say, I've been struggling to find a way to consistently keep notes, and notes which are not a bag of mess but actually organized and where I'm to get value beside the intrinsic value for learning by just writing stuff down.

So lets go back in time a bit. I've never really been good at keeping notes throughout my life, i begain to develop a habit of note taking (on paper) in my university days. And for sure it had a positive impact on the outcome of my studies, and atleast part of it, i credit to this act.

What i found was that the actual writing was the beneficial part, things stuck with me better. I rarely actually read back what I had previously written, and in the situations i did o often just wondered what the hell i was thinking when i wrote it...

Getting my first job as a software engineering and being somewhat overwhelmed with the information I was handed on a daily basis, I knew I would need an efficient system for this. And boy did a try, first on the list vad notion,then i also tried vimwiki and taskwarrior.

But none of those...
