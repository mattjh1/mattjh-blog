## Hello, I'm Mattias Holmgren

Welcome to my space! I'm a passionate and driven software engineer based in Kalmar, Sweden. I have a background in Computer Science and Software Engineering, and I'm currently working at tietoevry.
I live with my wonderful family, including my beautiful partner and two amazing daughters. Originally from Stockholm, I've been living in Kalmar for the past seven years.

I have a keen interest in prompt engineering, AI, and exploring the ever-evolving tech landscape. I enjoy sharing my knowledge and experiences through this blog.
Feel free to explore my projects, skills, and more. If you have any questions or just want to connect, you can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/mattjh1) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mattias-holmgren-b2407714a/).
