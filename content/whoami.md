## Hello, I'm Mattias Holmgren

{{< image src="me.jpg" alt="Me close" >}}

**Hello! Passionate about Linux, AI, automation—and building things? You’re in the right place.**

I’m a software engineer living in Sweden, originally from Stockholm but now calling the cozy town of Kalmar home. I share my life here with my amazing partner and our two wonderful daughters.

I thrive on diving into complex problems and finding creative ways to make them simpler, whether it’s through automation, clever workflows, or a bit of AI magic. But what I love most is **building things**—from useful tools and apps to quirky side projects I couldn’t resist tackling. This blog is where I share my journey—tips, tricks, and thoughts on everything from prompt engineering to crafting better solutions through code.

My main interests? Linux, automation, and exploring all the ways AI can make life easier and more fun. I’m constantly learning, tinkering, and building—not just to solve problems but to create something meaningful, efficient, or just plain cool.

Feel free to explore my posts and projects, or just say hi! You can reach [me@mattjh.sh](mailto:me@mattjh.sh)

Whether you’re here to learn, connect, or just browse, I’m happy you stopped by.
