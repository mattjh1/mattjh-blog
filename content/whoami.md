## Hello, I'm Mattias Holmgren

{{< image src="me.jpg" alt="Me close" >}}

**Hello! Passionate about Linux, AI, and automation? You’re in the right place.**

I’m a software engineer living in Sweden, originally from Stockholm but now calling the cozy town of Kalmar home. I share my life here with my amazing partner and our two wonderful daughters.

I love diving into complex problems and finding ways to make them simpler, whether it’s through automation, clever workflows, or a bit of AI magic. This blog is where I share what I’ve learned along the way—tips, tricks, and thoughts on everything from prompt engineering to quirky side projects I couldn’t resist tackling.

My main interests? Linux, automation, and exploring all the ways AI can make life easier and more fun. I’m constantly learning, tinkering, and looking for new ways to streamline and improve.

Feel free to explore my posts and projects, or just say hi! You can reach me at [me@mattjh.sh](mailto:me@mattjh.sh). Whether you’re here to learn, connect, or just browse, I’m happy you stopped by.
