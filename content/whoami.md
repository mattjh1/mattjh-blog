## Hello, I'm Mattias Holmgren

**Welcome to my space!** Iâ€™m originally from Stockholm and have been living in Kalmar for the past six years. As a passionate and self-motivated software engineer, I find great joy in simplifying complex problems. I love learning and sharing my thoughts on tech topics, particularly around productivity, customization, AI, and automation.

I live with my wonderful family, which includes my partner and our two amazing daughters. My interests lie in Linux, automation, prompt engineering, and exploring the ever-evolving tech landscape. Through this blog, I aim to share my knowledge and experiences.

Feel free to explore my projects and skills. If you have any questions or just want to connect, you can contact me at [me@mattjh.sh](mailto:me@mattjh.sh).
